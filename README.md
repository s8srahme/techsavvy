# Techsavvy

Techsavvy is a publishing platform built with ReactJS, Express and MongoDB in the Node-powered workflow.

This started as an attempt towards using Create React App to bootstrap a React project, connect the React app to an Express backend, and deploy the whole thing to Heroku.

Think of it as a free and open platform, where anyone can publish content with an easy to use editor, create user profile, follow their favourite writers, interact with them through clapping on their articles, and even leave meaningful responses.
